            <h2><a name="what is">What is Lorem Ipsum?</a></h2>

            <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
              industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text
              ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of
              type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
              It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
              electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
              popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
              containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
              publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
              of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

            <h3><a name="why do">Why do we use it?</a></h3>

            <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted
              by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.
              The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less
              normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
              'Content here, content here', making it look like readable
              English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors
              now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for
              'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.
              Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by
              accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>

            <h3><a name="where does">Where does it come from?</a></h3>

            <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random
              text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from
              45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin
              professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of
              the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum
              passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical
              literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes
              from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
              Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in
              45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very
              popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum,
              "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section
              1.10.32.</p>

            <p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is
              reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and
              1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also
              reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English
              versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>

            <h3><a name="where can">Where can I get some?</a></h3>

            <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available,
              but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by
              injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even
              slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem
              Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing
              hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on
              the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary,
              making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a
              dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of
              model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks
              reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free
              from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>
